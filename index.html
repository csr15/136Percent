                            <p>We are accomplished psychologists, trusted colleagues, and long-time fun friends. As
                                psychologists,
                                we understand the principles of behavior that keep us apart and those that help us to
                                come
                                together.
                                During this time of racial reckoning, we aim to apply these principles to build social
                                trust
                                among a
                                coalition of Black and White women invested in achieving racial equity.<span>Learn more

                                    transformative culture change.

                                <li>We believe that the quality of our interactions and how we come together to achieve
                                    racial equity is critical to our democracy.

                                <li>We believe that social trust, or the belief in the honesty, fairness and benevolence

                                    each other, is both an emotion and a choice.

                                <li>We believe that this is a moment in history when a critical mass of Black and White
                                    women can come together and make a choice to carry everyone forward toward that more

                                    between White and Black women, further deepening our historical divide. We know that
                                    trust between Black and White women is a critical factor to lessening that divide.

                                    a foundational aspect of an informed citizenry of Black and White women invested in

                        <li>The 136% Project gets its name from the 91% Black women and 45% White women voters who
                            support
                            racial equity as a pillar of the Biden/Harris Build Back Better plan. It is comprised of
                            Listening Circles, a Documentary Film, and Social Trust Forums:

                            Black and White women will be facilitated by Dr. Debbie and Dr. Lori (2021-2022).

                        <li>136% Project Documentary Film: With data gathered from the Listening Circles, we’ll produce
                            a
                            documentary describing how Black and White women experience contemporary race relations in

                            Black and White women. Together we’ll explore strategies for living within the duality of

                            and gender and develop competencies for the necessary individual and collective work of
